=== CRYPTO ADVISORY SNAPSHOT ===
Timestamp: 2025-08-18 13:37:10

--- BTC ---
Price: $115347.00
P/L: $16004.10 (86.04%)
Action: TAKE_PROFIT
Rationale: Your BTC position is significantly in profit (86.04%) and substantially above your original target price of $75,000. While BTC shows long-term bullish trends as indicated by SMAs, taking profits now secures substantial gains. The RSI is neutral, not indicating overbought conditions strongly, but the large profit margin suggests securing some of your investment is prudent, especially with the recent 24h price decline. Consider selling a portion of your holdings (e.g., 0.1 BTC) to secure profit and re-evaluate the market before reinvesting.
RSI: 50.5
MACD: 334.7890

--- ETH ---
Price: $4272.84
P/L: $5864.20 (37.83%)
Action: TAKE_PROFIT
Rationale: The position is currently very close to the target price of $4200. Taking profit at this level secures a substantial gain (37.83%) and reduces the risk of a potential pullback, especially considering the recent 24-hour price decrease. While ETH could potentially continue to rise, locking in profits near the target aligns with a prudent risk management approach.
RSI: 64.4
MACD: 235.9027
